These roasted pumpkin seeds are toasty, nutty, salty, and crunchy â€“ a healthy autumn treat thatâ€™s just too good to miss. If you have kids, I think this recipe would be a great one to make with them. Half the work is separating the seeds from the squishy, slimy pumpkin flesh.

Some I devour plain, their sticky juice dripping down my chin. But I use even more in my favorite peach recipes. As you might expect, these peach recipes include desserts like crisps and cobblers.

Itâ€™s PACKED with zucchini, of course, but it also features a few other good-for-you ingredients that you wouldnâ€™t find in a regular loaf. Almond flour adds protein and healthy fats, and it gives this loaf an especially moist texture.
