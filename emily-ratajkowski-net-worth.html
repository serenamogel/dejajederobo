Prince appropriated Emily’s posts from Instagram without her consent and showcased them as paintings at the Gagosian Gallery in New York.</p><p>Ratajkowski made a smart move with this seven years later, and instead of filing a lawsuit, she took a picture of herself in front of the painting and created a non-fungible token (NFT) from it.</p><p>The NFT fetched a whopping
