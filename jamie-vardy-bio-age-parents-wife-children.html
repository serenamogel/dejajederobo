style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><strong>Jamie Vardy Bio, Age, Parents, Wife, Children, Net Worth – Jamie Vardy is an English professional footballer who currently plays for Premier League club Leicester City as a striker.</strong></p><p>He is well-known for his prolific goal-scoring ability, which is aided by his movement, explosive pace, clinical finishing, and tactical acumen.</p><p>Vardy began his senior career with Stocksbridge Park Steels after being released by Sheffield Wednesday at the age of 16, breaking into the first team in 2007.</p><p>Prior to turning professional, Vardy worked as a technician making medical splints while also playing non-league football. Following an incident outside a pub, he was convicted of assault and sentenced to play with an electronic tag for six months.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jamie Vardy Biography</h2><p>Jamie Vardy grew up in the inner-city Sheffield neighborhood of Hillsborough. His stepfather was a crane operator, and his mother worked at a law firm.</p><p>Vardy grew up as a Sheffield Wednesday fan, idolizing striker, England international, and 1991 Football League Cup Finalist David Hirst.</p><p>Vardy recalls the intense rivalry he witnessed in Sheffield between fans of Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United in the 1990s and 2000s, which culminated in memorable Steel City derbies.</p><p>Vardy’s lifelong Sheffield Wednesday fandom led to some memorable celebrations against Sheffield United fans, including Leicester City’s 2-1 win over United, in which Vardy scored and celebrated in front of fans at Bramall Lane.</p><p>Vardy’s journey is distinguished by his lengthy stint in non-league football. Prior to his Premier League debut at the age of 27, he had already played in the English football league system at Levels 8, 7, 6, 5, and 2.</p><p>He attributes his late arrival in the Premier League to his ability to maintain longevity in football and play intensively even into his mid to late 30s.</p><p>Vardy was named one of the best strikers in the world by FourFourTwo in 2020, owing to his elite finishing ability, speed, and positional awareness.</p><p>Ian Wright, who rose through the ranks of non-league football to the Premier League and the English national team, predicted in October 2015 that Vardy could be England’s Salvatore Schillaci at UEFA Euro 2016: Schillaci, another late bloomer, started the 1990 FIFA World Cup as a substitute behind more established players and finished as the tournament’s leading scorer.</p><p>Vardy is known for his high work rate, relentless running, direct approach, two-footedness, and ability to link play, in addition to his prolific goal scoring.</p><p>He is regarded as a lightning-quick and dynamic striker with good positioning and a keen sense of space in the box.</p><p>These characteristics allow him to play on the last defender’s shoulder, time his runs to beat the defensive line, and stretch opponents, which, when combined with his speed and clinical finishing, makes him a threat on counter-attacks, which fits the style of Leicester City teams.</p><p>Vardy is also a skilled penalty taker, having converted 26 of 31 Premier League penalties. He also has good aerial ability and the ability to strike the ball powerfully with either foot.</p><p>Vardy drank heavily every night during his early days at the club, according to Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, and would arrive at training still intoxicated.</p><p>Srivaddhanaprabha talked with Vardy about what he wanted out of life, and Vardy quit drinking and began training more seriously as a result.</p><p>Other commentators, such as Jamie Jackson, have suggested that Vardy refocused following the earlier nightclub assault incident, and that the earlier arrival of Ella, his first daughter, was a stabilizing force.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jamie Vardy Age</h2><p>Jamie Vardy was born on January 11, 1987, so as of the year 2022, he was age 35 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jamie Vardy Height</h2><p>Jamie Vardy has a height of 1.79 meters.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jamie Vardy Parents</h2><p>He was born to Lisa Vardy, and Richard Gill.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jamie Vardy Wife</h2><p>Jamie Vardy is married to Rebekah Vardy, and they have been married since 2016.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jamie Vardy Children</h2><p>Jamie Vardy and his wife have two children – Sofia Vardy and Ella Vardy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jamie Vardy Net Worth</h2><p>Jamie Vardy is estimated to have a net worth of $12 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOYpqGVYsOivsOyZJuhn2KuqLGMqZirnZ6pwG7DyJ%2BcZpuYnrmlvsSnZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./seraf-n-zambada-ortiz.html>&#171;&nbsp;Serafn Zambada Ortiz</a>
