Fans have always been fascinated about the great actress and singer’s personal adventures, since she has had a number of high-profile partnerships over the years. So, who was Jennette McCurdy’s boyfriend in the past, and who will be Jennette McCurdy’s boyfriend in 2023?</strong></p><p>Jennette McCurdy rose to prominence as a young actress, appearing in shows such as “iCarly” and “Sam & Cat.” She has also had a number of popular singles and even her own album released. Despite her excellent profession, McCurdy has always been extremely discreet about her personal life.</p><p>In this article, we’ll look at Jennette McCurdy’s dating and love life, including her previous relationships and current situation. So, let’s get this party started!</p><h2><span id=Jennette_McCurdy8217s_Previous_Boyfriend>Jennette McCurdy’s Previous Boyfriend</span></h2><p>Jennette McCurdy’s dating past has piqued the interest of fans of the gifted actress and singer. McCurdy has been linked to a variety of celebrities throughout the years, including Graham Patrick Martin, Andre Drummond, and Paul Glaser. In this post, we will look at McCurdy’s previous dating life and her associations with these celebrities.</p><p>Jenette McCurdy’s previous boyfriends are listed below.</p><h2><span id=Patrick_Graham_Martin>Patrick Graham Martin</span></h2><p>Graham Patrick Martin, an actor, was linked to McCurdy. According to media reports, McCurdy and her then-boyfriend Martin dated from 2004 to 2008. Martin is most known for his work in television dramas such as “Two and a Half Men” and “Major Crimes.” He has also acted in films such as “The Social Network” and “Mad Max: Fury Road.”</p><p>Despite the dearth of information regarding their relationship, McCurdy and Martin appear to have maintained a low-key relationship. They were rarely seen together in public, and they didn’t reveal much about their relationship on social media.</p><p>In the end, McCurdy and her ex-beau Martin’s romance didn’t continue long, and the couple eventually split up. McCurdy has been associated to other celebrities afterwards.</p><h2><span id=Mr_Andre_Drummond>Mr. Andre Drummond</span></h2><p>Jennette McCurdy’s connection with her then-boyfriend Andre Drummond was a huge topic in the entertainment industry, and people were always concerned about their relationship status. In this article, we will look at McCurdy and Drummond’s previous dating lives as well as their current partnership.</p><p>Drummond is a basketball player with the Cleveland Cavaliers. He had a tremendous NBA career and is well-known for his rebounding and shot-blocking ability.</p><p>Jennette and her ex-partner Drummond met online in August 2013 and soon took their romance to social media. However, it should be mentioned that their relationship was only a brief affair. Jennette stopped her romance with Drummond after a few months since there was no connection. To this day, the actress and the NBA player are good friends.</p><h2><span id=Paul_Glaser_is_a_designer>Paul Glaser is a designer</span></h2><p>Jennette McCurdy dated the author of her own shoe ‘iCarly’ for a limited period of time. McCurdy was 18 when the final season of iCarly aired, and Paul Glaser was 13 years her senior. Because of the large age difference, some people on social media accused Paul Glaser of grooming her into being with him. McCurdy, on the other hand, holds a different viewpoint. She told Vulture in an interview:</p><p>“People would make very rude comments about him online, saying things like, ‘What a creep to have had an eye on her for so long.'” But they didn’t know the complete story, and that’s when I truly despised social media, thinking, ‘These people are making it hard for me.'”</p><p>During the same interview, she stated:</p><p>“I directed my feelings of love away from my mother, who had been the recipient of all that love up until that point, because I knew she was leaving, and I was panicking, and I think there was just a part of myself that was ready to redirect these feelings of love toward a new person.”</p><p>When her mother’s condition worsened, she said:</p><p>“I needed to go through that loss on my own because I was afraid of putting too much of myself into another person and becoming overly attached.” ‘Oh, if I share this grief with someone, and this part of myself with someone, and this reality with someone, then they become my reality,’ I reasoned. That concept terrified me.”</p><h2><span id=Jennette_McCurdy_and_Paul_Glaser_collaborate>Jennette McCurdy and Paul Glaser collaborate</span></h2><p>She abandoned her connection with Glaser after her mother’s health began to deteriorate. She stated “needing to go through that loss alone” as one of her motivations. Her mother passed away later that year.</p><h2><span id=Carere_Jesse>Carere, Jesse</span></h2><p>Rumors circulated in 2015 that McCurdy was in love with her co-star Jesse Carere after her breakup with Paul Glaser. When asked about their connection, the American writer and director stated:</p><p>“I feel like I’m learning to love in all the right ways and to accept love for who I am rather than an impressive version of myself; I think I learned to be whatever person people needed me to be from a young age.”</p><h2><span id=Jennette_McCurdy_and_Jesse_Carere>Jennette McCurdy and Jesse Carere</span></h2><p>However, it is unknown what happened between the two, as McCurdy deleted all of her photos with Jesse Carere from her social media accounts sometime in 2016.</p><h2><span id=Jennette_McCurdy_dating_in_2023>Jennette McCurdy dating in 2023?</span></h2><p>Regardless of her previous relationships, McCurdy has always claimed to be a hopeless romantic with a great desire to find love. McCurdy claimed in an interview with People Magazine that she is still looking for “the one,” and that she is open to finding love with someone who is not in the entertainment field.</p><p>“I would love to find someone who is not in the industry,” McCurdy remarked. “I feel like that would be a nice change of pace and a nice balance for my life.”</p><h2><span id=McCurdy_as_he_appears_in_2022>McCurdy as he appears in 2022</span></h2><p>Despite having a number of high-profile romances in the past, Jennette McCurdy does not have a boyfriend in 2023. While she is open to love, she is equally dedicated to self-love and independence. We have no doubt that McCurdy will find the love and happiness she deserves in due time, given her brilliant career and bright future.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/"}{"1":50}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>American writer</a></span><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Heinrich Christian Boie</a></h3>Heinrich Christian Boie estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
