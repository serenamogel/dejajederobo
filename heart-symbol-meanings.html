For example, one school interprets its symbolism as representative of four interconnected entities. More specifically, it can be considered to illustrate four <a href=#>unique expressions</a> of creation.</p><p>In this model, the first symbol of the heart is that of the resting place for the creative spirit. Second, the heart acts as the foundation source from which creative, vibrant <a href=#>energy flows</a>. As you can probably see, the creative spirit and flow of energy that sustains the soul are the same thing, expressed differently.</p><p>Third, this organ is the location of your <a href=#>true intention</a> in life. If we follow the flow of energy that seeps from our hearts, we will access that intention. Lastly, the heart symbolizes the dreams that we wish to manifest.</p><p>Combining these four elements makes the heart a perfect symbol for the <a href=#>flowing of energy</a>, the realization of our desires, and the choosing of our paths.</p><h3>Heart Symbol: Love</h3><p>While the above-mentioned theories are certainly valid, there are still other ways of interpreting the heart. After all, we must apply symbols to specific situations and sets of circumstances if we want to comprehend them completely. However, some common and universal themes are widely accepted as connected with the heart, such as <a href=#>love and attraction</a>, cohesion, and unity. Magicians and alchemists of times past typically used heart symbols in matters related to love.</p><p>Hearts were also used in rituals to strengthen one’s relationships. They were not the only people, though, who recognized the positive, uplifting, and sentimental aspects of the heart’s symbolism. The Roman Catholic Church uses the Sacred Heart of Christ as an emblem of truth and the infinite nature of the Lord’s love.</p><h3>Heart Symbol: Inverted Triangle & Chakras</h3><p>Alternately, the meanings behind the heart can be displayed <a href=#>graphically as an inverted triangle</a>. This image symbolizes a vessel from which love is poured or carried. As water is also poured from this type of vessel, we can associate the upside triangle with the <a href=#>element of water</a> and, by the transitive property, all of the themes connected to water: motion, intuition, transitions, and fluid emotion.</p><p>Also, the inverted triangle has long been viewed as a symbol of femininity and maternal energies. The upside-down triangle also plays a role in the chakras of Hinduism. As the focal point in the center of the <a href=#>root chakra</a> (Muladhara), the triangle taps into the primal and sexual powers within us, the powers that surge upward through the remaining chakras. This shape can also be found in the other chakras, such as the <a href=#>solar plexus/navel chakra</a> (Manipura), <a href=#>heart chakra</a> (Anahata), <a href=#>throat chakra</a> (Vishuda), and the <a href=#>third eye chakra</a> (Ajna).</p><p>As with all other symbols, meaning is truly within the eye of the beholder. No one interpretation can be considered right or wrong, as everyone’s experiences are different. Whatever any culture, group, or individual says about any symbol will always have differences, even if they are subtle. Open your heart (pun intended) and allow this symbol to <a href=#>speak directly</a> to you.</p><h2>Heart Symbolism Summary</h2><p>In a word, The Heart Symbolism says you need to keep developing and tapping your intuition to access amazing ideas and solutions than ever before.</p><p><strong>See Also:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMHNrKCgpqNjvLOzjqGcmqqkYsC6ucGoo2allZa7qrrGrGY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-october-a-good-month-for-sorrento.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is October a good month for Sorrento?</a>
