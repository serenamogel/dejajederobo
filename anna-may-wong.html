Though as a Chinese American she was often limited to smaller roles that fit the Asian stereotypes expected by white producers and audiences, Wong still managed to put her own stamp on the parts she was allotted. She built a career that spanned silent films, talkies, the theater and television before her death at the age of 56 in 1961. Wong has since been recognized as an iconic Asian American actress who dealt with difficult circumstances and helped blaze a trail for subsequent generations of performers.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Family</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wong was born Wong Liu Tsong in Los Angeles, California, on January 3, 1905. Her parents, Wong Sam Sing and Lee Gon Toy, were second-generation Chinese Americans. Wong's grandparents arrived in California before immigration from China to the United States was restricted at the end of the 19th century.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wong was the second of her parents' seven children. The family ran a laundry and lived close to the business. Growing up, Wong spent countless hours working in the laundry or making deliveries to clients.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the integrated elementary school Wong attended with her older sister, they had to endure racist taunts from their classmates. Wong later <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://chineseamerican.nyhistory.org/anna-may-wong-1905-1961/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said</a> of the experience, "Every day was one of torture for us." Her parents then transferred the girls to the Chinese Mission School, which had a Chinese American student body.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Career Beginnings</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wong's childhood gave her the opportunity to see Hollywood films shooting in Chinatown. She displayed such an avid interest that she was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/11/movies/film-a-dragon-lady-and-a-quiet-cultural-warrior.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=dubbed class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">dubbed</a> the "curious Chinese child." Despite paternal disapproval, Wong <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1024222,00.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dreamed of pursuing a career" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">dreamed of pursuing a career</a> in the movies. She selected Anna May Wong as a stage name and at 14 got her start as an extra in The Red Lantern (1919).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wong left high school in 1921 to concentrate on acting. At the age of 17, she was given a starring role in the Madame Butterfly-inspired The Toll of the Sea (1922). She delivered a good performance in the picture, which was one of the first Technicolor films. Wong's supporting turn alongside Douglas Fairbanks as a Mongol slave girl (and spy) in The Thief of Bagdad (1924) made her a bigger success. In 1924 she set up her own production company, The Anna May Wong Productions. The operation soon folded, thanks to an underhanded business partner, but she continued to get work in movies.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Yet Wong was feeling constrained by Hollywood. It was common for white actors to be cast in Asian roles, using makeup and costumes to appear Asian. The practice, known as "yellowface," was not only offensive, it limited the parts available to Wong, who <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://chineseamerican.nyhistory.org/anna-may-wong-1905-1961/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=noted class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">noted</a>, "Rather than real Chinese, producers prefer Hungarians, Mexicans, American Indians for Chinese roles."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition, studios did not permit interracial kisses in films, thanks to anti-miscegenation laws in the United States. This meant Wong was not eligible for starring roles that involved a romantic pairing with white actors. Instead, she was typecast in smaller parts, often as either a subservient woman or a scheming "dragon lady." Her characters frequently died via sacrifice or as comeuppance.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Move to Europe</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Given the limits Wong faced in Hollywood, in 1928 she decided to go to Europe and pursue her career in Germany and England. She earned plaudits for 1929's Piccadilly, which was her final silent film. Wong then entered the world of talkies; in different versions of The Flame of Love (1930), she spoke French, English and German.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wong appeared in London with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/laurence-olivier data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Laurence Olivier" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Laurence Olivier</a> in the 1929 play A Circle of Chalk and in Vienna with a musical play Tschun-Tshi, which she wrote. While in Europe, Wong, who'd worked as a model growing up, also became a fashion trendsetter.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Return to America</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1930, Wong was back in the United States for a successful run on Broadway in the play On the Spot. However, one aspect of her return would never have been experienced by her white counterparts. Wong had been born in the United States, but due to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/immigration/chinese-exclusion-act-1882 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chinese Exclusion Act" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Chinese Exclusion Act</a> and subsequent amendments, prior to traveling abroad, she'd been required to go to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for a certificate of identity that would allow her to re-enter the country.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wong later signed with Paramount Studios. Daughter of the Dragon (1931) saw her playing another stereotype, though at least she was the headline star. Shanghai Express (1932) had Wong sharing the screen with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/marlene-dietrich data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marlene Dietrich" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Marlene Dietrich</a>, a friend from her time in Europe and was a higher quality film.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Yet Wong still didn't get many roles beyond melodramatic B movies. She <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-07-12-ca-3279-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="expressed some of her frustration" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">expressed some of her frustration</a> in a 1933 interview, "Why is it that the screen Chinese is nearly always the villain of the piece, and so cruel a villain â murderous, treacherous, a snake in the grass. We are not like that. How should we be, with a civilization that's so many times older than that of the West. We have our own virtues. We have our rigid code of behavior, of honor. Why do they never show these on the screen?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When the film version of The Good Earth, based on Pearl Buck's novel about a rural Chinese family, was being cast in 1935, Wong <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1024222,00.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=hoped class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">hoped</a> to play the lead role of O-Lan. She did screen tests but was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies/google-honors-chinese-american-movie-star-anna-may-wong/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="not truly considered" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">not truly considered</a> by the studio. Wong was then asked to test for Lotus, a conniving concubine. She was ultimately offered that part but turned it down, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-07-12-ca-3279-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=explaining class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">explaining</a>, "You're asking me â with Chinese blood â to do the only unsympathetic role in the picture, featuring an all-American cast portraying Chinese characters."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The part Wong wanted was given to the white Luise Rainer, who went on to win an Oscar for her performance.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Trip to China</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the disappointing casting decision for The Good Earth, Wong stepped away from Hollywood and visited China in 1936. There, she faced <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-07-12-ca-3279-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=criticism class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">criticism</a> for portraying stereotypes on screen, though <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-07-12-ca-3279-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she countered" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she countered</a> that she hadn't been the one responsible for those roles. She later <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/mar/13/featuresreviews.guardianreview5 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said</a>, "It's a pretty sad situation to be rejected by Chinese because I'm 'too American' and by American producers because they prefer other races to act Chinese parts."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The trip did give Wong the chance to learn more about China and its culture. She wrote about her journey for The New York Herald Tribune and The Los Angeles Times.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Daughter of Shanghai (1937) allowed Wong a happy ending with a Korean American male lead, which was unusual for her oeuvre. During <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/world-war-ii-history data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World War II" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">World War II</a>, she made Bombs over Burama (1942) and Lady from Chungking (1942). She also raised money for China, which had been invaded by Japan.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wong retired from acting in 1942, though she continued to make occasional film and TV appearances. In 1951, she became the first Asian American with the lead role in a TV series, The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong, in which she portrayed an amateur investigator with a day job as an art dealer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wong had a small part in the film Portrait in Black (1960) as star Lana Turner's maid. Her final movie appearance was in The Savage Innocents (1961). She'd wanted to make a comeback in the Hollywood version of the musical Flower Drum Song, but passed away before production began.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wong never married. There were <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/11/movies/film-a-dragon-lady-and-a-quiet-cultural-warrior.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=rumors class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">rumors</a> that she was romantically involved with Dietrich and white men. Even if this gossip was accurate, the laws and prejudices of Wong's day meant these relationships couldn't have resulted in marriage.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death and Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wong died on February 3, 1961, in Santa Monica, California. She was 56. The cause of death was a heart attack. She'd suffered from liver disease for years prior to her passing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The documentary Anna May Wong: In Her Own Words explored Wong's life. Another documentary, Searching for Anna May Wong, considered if Wong would face the same career obstacles in the present day. The TV series Hollywood featured Wong as a character, though her storyline was fictionalized.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wong has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and has been the subject of biographies such as Anna May Wong: From Laundrymanâs Daughter to Hollywood Legend and Perpetually Cool: The Many Lives of Anna May Wong.</p><ul data-node-id=37 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Anna May Wong</li><li>Birth Year: 1905</li><li>Birth date: January 3, 1905</li><li>Birth State: California</li><li>Birth City: Los Angeles</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Best Known For: Anna May Wong was the first Chinese American movie star, but her career was limited by racism and discrimination.</li><li>Astrological Sign: Capricorn</li><li>Death Year: 1961</li><li>Death date: February 3, 1961</li><li>Death State: California</li><li>Death City: Santa Monica</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=40><ul data-node-id=42 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Anna May Wong Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actors/anna-may-wong</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: May 11, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: May 11, 2021</li></ul><ul data-node-id=45 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>It is hard to get into the pictures, but it is harder to keep in them.
