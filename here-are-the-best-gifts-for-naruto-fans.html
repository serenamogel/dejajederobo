A close second to Akira Toriyama’s Dragon Ball Z, Naruto revolves around the young shinobi Naruto Uzumaki as he develops his ninja skills against powerful adversaries on his quest to become Hokage.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=824 data-injectable=true>For many people, the vibrant art and intriguing symbols are undeniably attractive, especially in terms of fashion and design.

However, if you have a friend that wasn’t already a fan, there’s a good chance that they are unaware of Naruto’s humble beginnings as the aspiring 10-year-old shinobi struggling to perform ninja art in the Leaf Village. Thankfully, that’s what DVDs are still here for.</p><p data-characters=567 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>Naruto Uncut Season 1 is a volume 1 standard edition DVD that comes in a boxed set. Basically compiled as an animation movie, the boxed set covers the first part of Naruto’s long-standing saga and provides a lot of context for the storylines of its later seasons. Of course, you can always stream Naruto for free on Crunchyroll, but this gift is a more tangible way of commemorating the series. A great collector’s item for Naruto fans and simple enthusiasts, Naruto Uncut Season 1 is a good gift choice with an affordable price tag of $19.99.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>There are a few other boxed sets that cover Naruto’s days as a kid, but this list would be a lot longer if we tried to cover them all.

The manga is the source material for the anime, so reading as a beginner will provide all the information you need to catch up. It also looks really nice on a bookshelf when you have the entire set.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>For a fan, this is an absolute must-have. Outside of the visual aesthetics, the manga volume set is a status of pride to show one’s dedication to the anime. Whether your friend is a fan or not, this thoughtful gift is sure to keep them preoccupied for a while after the holiday season.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Naruto Shippuden boxed set 1</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/40673_haTTBrbeKfkiuvIJX6vK5sZgN.jpg><p data-characters=590 data-current-count=890 data-injectable=true>After watching the first Naruto boxed set, the next item on the list is the first Naruto Shippuden boxed set.
