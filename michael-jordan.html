His mother, Deloris, was a bank teller who has since written several books. His father, James, was a maintenance worker turned manager at General Electric.

He was the third overall pick, behind Hakeem Olajuwon, who was selected first by the Houston Rockets, and Sam Bowie, taken by the Portland Trail Blazers; the draft also featured legendary players John Stockton and Charles Barkley.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jordan soon proved himself on the court. He helped the Bulls make the playoffs and scored an average of 28.2 points per game that season. For his efforts, Jordan received the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and was selected for the All-Star Game.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although his second season was marred by injury, he broke new ground on the court during the 1986-87 season. He became the first player since <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/wilt-chamberlain data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Wilt Chamberlain" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Wilt Chamberlain</a> to score more than 3,000 points in a single season. By the late 1980s, the Chicago Bulls were quickly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and Jordan was an instrumental part of the team’s success.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Bulls made it to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1990 and won their first NBA championship the following year by defeating the Los Angeles Lakers. Jordan was well known by then for his superior athleticism on the court and for his leadership abilities.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1992, the Chicago Bulls beat the Portland Trail Blazers to win their second NBA championship. The team took their third championship the following year, dominating in the basketball world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following the 1993 death of his father and a short stint in minor league baseball, Jordan returned to the basketball court and the Bulls in March 1995. He came back even stronger the following year, averaging 30.4 points per game to lead the Bulls to a then-record 72 regular-season wins before they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics for the NBA championship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Chicago nearly matched the previous year’s record with 69 wins in 1996-97, a season that ended with a Game 6 win over the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals. The two teams faced each other again for the championship in 1998, with Jordan sinking the winning shot in Game 6 to claim his sixth and final title. In addition to those six rings, Jordan won each of his five league MVP awards with Chicago.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After his second retirement from basketball in 1999, Jordan joined the Washington Wizards in 2000 as a part owner and as president of basketball operations. In the fall of 2001, Jordan relinquished these roles to return to the court once more. He played for the Wizards for his final two NBA seasons.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 title="Jordan’s Jersey Numbers" data-anchor-id=jordans-jersey-numbers class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Jordan’s Jersey Numbers</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jordan is most famous for donning No. 23 during the majority of his career.

That lasted only a couple months before Jordan switched back to 23 during the 1995 playoffs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jordan famously wore No. 12 for one game on February 14, 1990, because <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.si.com/nba/bulls/old-school/the-story-of-why-michael-jordan-wore-no-12-in-a-game-against-orlando data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="his jersey" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">his jersey</a> had been stolen. The Bulls didn’t have a backup and tried to locate a 23 jersey in the stands that would fit Jordan but couldn’t. The temporary change didn’t affect his performance, as Jordan scored 49 points in a loss to the Orlando Magic.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 title=Olympics data-anchor-id=olympics class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Olympics</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the summer of 1984, Jordan made his first appearance at the Olympic Games as a member of the U.S. Olympic basketball team.

He first stepped away on October 6, 1993, at age 30 to pursue a career in baseball following the death of his father. In July of that year, James was murdered when two teenagers shot him in his car in an apparent robbery as he was driving from Charlotte to Wilmington, North Carolina. He was missing for 23 days until his body was found in a swamp in McColl, South Carolina. The teens were later tried and convicted of the crime and received life sentences for first-degree murder.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jordan retired from the Bulls again on January 13, 1999, at age 35 before eventually returning to the court with the Wizards.

For one year in 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, as an outfielder.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">This decision came shortly following the murder of Jordan’s father, who always wanted him to play baseball.

Jordan signed his first deal with Nike in 1984. The company launched its signature Air Jordan basketball sneakers in 1985. In its initial contract, Nike gave Jordan a generous 25 percent in royalties.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Air Jordan quickly proved very popular, and it continues to be a best-seller for the apparel maker more than 30 years later.

The Gatorade partnership featured a memorable ad campaign encouraging kids and adults to “Be Like Mike.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=65 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1998, Jordan launched into the restaurant business as the owner of Michael Jordan’s The Steak House N.Y.C.

In 2010, he became the majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets and serves as the team’s chairman.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=69 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Improving the team’s less-than-stellar record seemed to be Jordan’s priority. In November 2012, he told ESPN: “I don’t anticipate getting out of this business. My competitive nature is I want to succeed. It’s always been said that when I can’t find a way to do anything, I will find a way to do it.” While the Hornets’ on-court record wasn’t hugely successful—they failed to make the playoffs six straight seasons from 2016 through 2022—the organization grew from a $175 million valuation in 2006 to $1.7 billion by October 2022.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=70 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In March 2023, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/35875056/michael-jordan-talks-sell-majority-stake-hornets-sources-say data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ESPN reported" data-vars-ga-product-id=038e4f30-ced1-4094-aa50-1017f2d1344c data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/35875056/michael-jordan-talks-sell-majority-stake-hornets-sources-say data-product-url=https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/35875056/michael-jordan-talks-sell-majority-stake-hornets-sources-say data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fnba%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F35875056%2Fmichael-jordan-talks-sell-majority-stake-hornets-sources-say" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$16.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=9ead3ea0-9611-4c0b-b5c3-d85d200fdf53 class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">ESPN reported</a> that Jordan was in talks to sell his majority stake in the franchise to a group led by two NBA minority owners.
