segregated people based on the color of their skin for more than 50 years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Noah was born in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1984. With a Black mother and white Swiss father, he was, as he wrote in his bestselling 2016 autobiography, born a crime. Under apartheid laws, which officially governed South Africa between 1948 and 1994, race was the country’s defining cultural and legal factor. The <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thoughtco.com/prohibition-of-mixed-marriages-act-43464 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mixed Marriages Act of 1949" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Mixed Marriages Act of 1949</a> banned marriage between white people and people of color, while other laws enacted early in the regime prohibited people of different races from even living near one another.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Noah's mother had to pretend to be a stranger to her son when they were out in public</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While apartheid’s political grip was slowly weakening by the mid-1980s, Noah’s childhood was still shaped by the legal and cultural power it held over the country. His very existence was criminal, which meant that he spent his early years always in some kind of hiding, whether literal or in plain sight.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“My grandmother kept me locked in the house when I was staying with the family in Soweto,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.npr.org/2016/11/22/503009220/trevor-noah-looks-back-on-childhood-in-the-shadow-of-a-giant-his-mom#:%7e:text=on%20Fresh%20Air-,Trevor%20Noah%20Says%20He%20Grew%20Up%20'In%20The%20Shadow,A%20Giant'%20(His%20Mom)&text=Spiegel%20%26%20Grau-,Daily%20Show%20host%20Trevor%20Noah%20was%20born,Africa%20and%20speaks%20six%20languages.&text=As%20the%20child%20of%20a,a%20crime%20had%20been%20committed." data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=NPR class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">NPR</a> in 2016, referring to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/06/trevor-noah-from-soweto-to-home-american-satire data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="town where he grew up" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">town where he grew up</a>, which to this day has a 99 percent Black population. “If the police did show up ... it was a constant game of hide-and-seek."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even out in public, Noah’s experience was predicated on deception. When they walked around Soweto, his mother, Patricia, would often pretend to be a stranger, or at least someone other than his mother. As he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://parade.com/523455/lhochwald/trevor-noah-shares-his-childhood/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Parade class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Parade</a>, this was generally the only way for them to walk outside together without the authorities bothering his mother and arresting her for having a biracial child.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It didn’t help that his neighbors and other people in the community were often collaborators in the police state’s surveillance and strict enforcement of racial bigotry and segregation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“People were encouraged to snitch,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.npr.org/2016/11/22/503009220/trevor-noah-looks-back-on-childhood-in-the-shadow-of-a-giant-his-mom#:%7e:text=on%20Fresh%20Air-,Trevor%20Noah%20Says%20He%20Grew%20Up%20'In%20The%20Shadow,A%20Giant'%20(His%20Mom)&text=Spiegel%20%26%20Grau-,Daily%20Show%20host%20Trevor%20Noah%20was%20born,Africa%20and%20speaks%20six%20languages.&text=As%20the%20child%20of%20a,a%20crime%20had%20been%20committed." data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=remembered class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">remembered</a>. “It could be your neighbor if you were living in a white area; it could be your neighbor if you were living in a Black area.

Frequently, she would be caught doing so, which would result in her being sent away to prison for weeks at a time. The government didn’t bother notifying her family about these stints in jail, resulting in a life filled with even more fear and paranoia.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thanks to the work of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/nelson-mandela data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nelson Mandela" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Nelson Mandela</a> and generations of freedom fighters, South Africa’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/africa/apartheid data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="apartheid regime collapsed in 1994" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">apartheid regime collapsed in 1994</a>. Noah was 10 years old at the time and ready to embrace a new kind of freedom. But for all the legal doors that the end of apartheid opened, attitudes took longer to change, and the economic inequality created by the nearly 50 years of segregation (and centuries of colonialism before it) meant that his struggles continued.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Most of his adolescence and early adulthood was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://qz.com/africa/872839/trevor-noah-went-from-selling-ripped-cds-to-hosting-the-daily-show-in-just-over-10-years/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="spent on the streets of Alexandra" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">spent on the streets of Alexandra</a>, a place he refers to as “the hood” in his memoir. He didn’t have the money for college tuition, so he hustled for all the cash he could get — Noah DJ’d, sold counterfeit CDs, moved very probably stolen goods and kept on a treadmill of disaffection in a time of national transition.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“The tricky thing about the hood is that you’re always working, working, working, and you feel like something’s happening, but really nothing’s happening at all,” he wrote in his memoir.</p><img alt="Trevor Noah memoir" title="Trevor Noah memoir" width=1997 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-627276372.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Trevor Noah with his book "Born A Crime."; Photo: GP Images/WireImage</span></p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Noah credits his mother as the moral center of his life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Making matters worse, while his mother moved on to a new relationship, the man she married wound up being an abusive alcoholic. Things came to a head only after she left the stepfather in 2009, when the stepfather, jealous of her new engagement, shot Noah's mother in the back of the head. The bullet narrowly missed her brain, which spared her life. It was a devastating event, made worse by the fact that the stepfather then <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3023806/How-stepfather-new-Daily-host-Trevor-Noah-tried-hunt-kill-shooting-mother-leaving-dead-South-African-slum-comedian-raised.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="tried to hunt down Noah" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">tried to hunt down Noah</a> himself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I remember after the shooting, my mother was in the hospital, and all I felt was rage,” Noah recalled to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/tv/2017/05/31/trevor-noah-stepfather-shot-mother/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Weekly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2017. “My mother said to me, ‘Don’t hate him for doing this, but rather pity him because he too is a victim, in his own way, of a world that has thrust upon him an idea of masculinity that he has subscribed to and is now a part of. As for myself, I do not wish to imbue myself with a hatred that only I will carry.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It took a while for him to understand what his mother was really saying, but he ultimately came around to the message. In fact, Noah credits his mother as the moral center of his life; she taught him how to be decent, how to be funny and how to combine those two in order to ascend to the heights he has now reached.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"I thought that I was the hero of my story, [but] in writing it I came to realize over time that my mom was the hero," Noah told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.npr.org/2016/11/22/503009220/trevor-noah-looks-back-on-childhood-in-the-shadow-of-a-giant-his-mom#:%7e:text=on%20Fresh%20Air-,Trevor%20Noah%20Says%20He%20Grew%20Up%20'In%20The%20Shadow,A%20Giant'%20(His%20Mom)&text=Spiegel%20%26%20Grau-,Daily%20Show%20host%20Trevor%20Noah%20was%20born,Africa%20and%20speaks%20six%20languages.&text=As%20the%20child%20of%20a,a%20crime%20had%20been%20committed." data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=NPR class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">NPR</a>.
